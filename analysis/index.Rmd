# Data Analysis Flow

## Introduction

-   Briefly introduce the purpose of the data analysis and the dataset being used.

```{r}
use <- function(file_name) {
  source(paste0(getwd(), "/code/", file_name))
}

use('helpers.R')
hello_world()
```

## Data Preparation

-   Load the necessary libraries.
-   Import the dataset.
-   Explore the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
-   Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
-   Perform any necessary data transformations (e.g., scaling, encoding, etc.).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Generate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
-   Visualize the data using appropriate plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.).
-   Identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
-   Conduct statistical tests or calculations to gain insights.

## Data Modeling

-   Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
-   Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm or statistical model.
-   Train the model using the training set.
-   Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
-   Fine-tune the model if necessary (e.g., hyperparameter tuning).
-   Validate the model using the testing set.

## Results and Conclusion

-   Summarize the findings from the data analysis.
-   Present the results using visualizations and tables.
-   Discuss the implications and limitations of the analysis.
-   Provide recommendations or next steps based on the results.

## References

-   List any references or sources used in the analysis.
